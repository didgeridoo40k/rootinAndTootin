# rootinAndTootin
Global Game Jam Jan 2023

The working game script is:
rootinAndTootin/rootinAndTootin/script/GGJ_2023_Script_finished.odt
This can be opened with most document editing software. I recommend LibreOffice Writer.

The renpy project is in:
rootinAndTootin/rootinAndTootin/game/

script.rpy
Is the main project file where all the logic and markup takes place.

The games backgrounds and sprites go in:
rootinAndTootin/rootinAndTootin/game/images

The vroid project files and renders for character design go in:
rootinAndTootin/Vroid/testing/
